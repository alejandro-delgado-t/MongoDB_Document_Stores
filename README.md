## Project Overview
This project explores three distinct document modeling strategies using MongoDB, focusing on how different approaches to structuring data affect performance. The scenario mimics a simplified HR-like database with two key entities: Persons (e.g., employees) and Companies (e.g., employers).

Using synthetic data generated with Python, we model the same dataset in three waysâ€”ranging from normalized to fully denormalized designs. We then insert each model into MongoDB and benchmark their performance on a set of representative queries. This hands-on test helps assess trade-offs between normalization and denormalization in NoSQL databases, particularly regarding query performance and update efficiency.

## Description of Model Scripts

- **Model Selection (model_selection.py)**: Main interface for selecting and running models - when executed, will provide an interactive command-line interface in which the user is prompted to select a data model and feed in input parameters directly through the Python terminal.
- **Model 1 (model1.py)**: Normalized design where `Person` and `Company` are separate documents. Persons reference their company using `company_id`.
- **Model 2 (model2.py)**: Denormalized design where each `Person` document embeds their associated `Company` object.
- **Model 3 (model3.py)**: Denormalized design where each `Company` document embeds a list of `Person` documents (employees).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- MongoDB running locally (port `27017`)
- Python packages:
  - `pymongo`
  - `time`
  - `faker`
  - `random`
  - `datetime`
  - `tabulate` (optional)

Install packages with:

```bash
pip install pymongo faker tabulate
```

## How to Run

1. Make sure a local MongoDB instance is running, and ensure that the MongoDB client is properly instantiated in all three models.
2. Install the necessary Python packages in your environment.
3. Begin the project by executing the model_selection.py script from a command prompt.
4. When prompted, choose one of the three data-modeling options and present the requested numbers for employees and companies.
5. The script will: generate synthetic data, insert it into MongoDB, execute the four benchmark queries, and report the timing results.
6. Having completed this, opt to execute another model or exit the menu.
